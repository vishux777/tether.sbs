# Finding Missing Profiles in Users2 Table

## ✅ Profile Insertion Works!

The test shows profile insertion is working when called directly. But you can't find data in Users2 table.

## Debugging Steps:

### 1. Check Your Server Console

When you register via the frontend, **check the terminal where `npm run server` is running**. You should see:

**✅ Success (Profile Inserted):**
```
✅ Profile inserted into Users2 table successfully
   User ID: uuid-here
   Email: user@example.com
   Created At: timestamp
```

**❌ Error (Profile Not Inserted):**
```
❌ Profile creation failed (user still registered):
   Error: [error message]
   Code: [error code]
   Details: [details]
```

**⚠️ Warning (Admin Client Not Initialized):**
```
⚠️  supabaseAdmin not initialized - profile will NOT be inserted into Users2
   Missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in .env file
```

### 2. Check Supabase Dashboard

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Table Editor → Users2**
   - Click on "Users2" table
   - Check if there are any rows
   - Look for users you registered

3. **If table is empty:**
   - Check server console for errors
   - Profile insertion might be failing silently

### 3. Common Issues:

#### Issue #1: Server Console Shows Errors
**If you see error messages in server console:**
- Copy the exact error message
- Check what the error says
- Common errors:
  - `relation "Users2" does not exist` → Table name wrong
  - `column does not exist` → Missing column in table
  - `foreign key violation` → ID doesn't match auth.users

#### Issue #2: No Server Console Messages
**If you don't see any profile insertion messages:**
- Registration might be failing before profile insertion
- Check if registration is actually succeeding
- Look for any errors in the server console

#### Issue #3: Table Exists But Empty
**If table exists but no rows:**
- Check server console for insertion errors
- Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set
- Try running: `node test-profile-insertion.js` to test directly

### 4. Quick Tests:

#### Test Profile Insertion Directly:
```bash
node test-profile-insertion.js
```
This will show you exactly if insertion works.

#### Check Configuration:
```bash
node check-supabase-config.js
```
Verify all keys are set correctly.

#### Test Registration Endpoint:
```bash
# Register and check server console
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"Test123!"}'
```

Then check your server console for profile insertion messages.

### 5. What to Share:

If you still can't find the data, share:

1. **What you see in server console when registering:**
   - Any error messages?
   - Success messages?
   - Nothing at all?

2. **What you see in Supabase Dashboard:**
   - How many rows in Users2 table?
   - What columns exist?
   - Any data at all?

3. **When you run the test:**
   ```bash
   node test-profile-insertion.js
   ```
   Does this show success or failure?

This will help identify exactly where the issue is!
